# Doggo Food

This project is made as a challenge for Badi and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can access to a live version [here](https://doggo-food.netlify.com/)

## Main libraries

[Styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for css-in-js styles.

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as an HTTP client.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

[Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) as a testing utility that makes it easier to test your React Components.

## Setup

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run coverage`

To run test with coverage report.

### Deployment

The deployment is made with [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)

## Design

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design the mockups and [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) for icons.
